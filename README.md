# Markmate
Your personal bookmark manager.

## Motivation
I have had A LOT of bookmarks (around 400+). My biggest problem is, I have lost the context on why I saved this bookmark.
Classification under folders and with hashtags do help you to organize, but I still felt the need to add more context to it.
Also, I feel like the source from which the bookmark originated also matters a lot as it will help to create a better context.
